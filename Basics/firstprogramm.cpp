// NOTE :

// DO NOT WRITE THE FILE NAMES USING SPACE,LIKE first program.cpp my name.cpp etc do not include space between words while naming  the cpp file.
// it throws _set_error_mode
// Always use .cpp for c++ files,to recognize them as cpp file
// And Save the file beforing compiling

#include <iostream>
// this is an header file ,we use it to include some content in our code,this is done by #include word
// iostream is an header file which supports the input and outputs 
// using namespace std is used to print the output in the standard output that is concsole,stasndard input mean keyboard
using namespace std;
// main() is the function,from wheer the programm execution starts,compiler checks the lines from starting ,once it hits the function main it starts compiling
// int is nothing but the return type, return type mean the value return by the main function is what type whether it is int or float or long int etc

int main()
{
    cout << "saisri angajala";
    // cout prints the output to the console,like print function in python cout<<"some text" iis the syntax
    return 0;
    // return says the what the function will return, getting zero from the fnction mean succesful termination of the fuction
